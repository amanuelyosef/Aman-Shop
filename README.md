# Aman Shop

A peer-to-peer shopping app built using Jetpack Compose, open-sourced for contribution and learning purposes. The app focuses on UI implementation and provides a foundation for future logic development.

This shopping app's UI is created for demonstration and practice and is not connected to any API. All its resources are defined within the app or saved locally.

The app was created to enhance Jetpack Compose skills and serve as a foundation for future projects. It is open-source to gather recommendations and receive contributions to improve the UI and overall structure.

**Note**: All listed features are implemented as UI only; logic implementations are not included. The app includes some non-functional endpoints (e.g., selling, user registration) for demonstration purposes. Contributions are welcome, as the app is still in early development.
